Upon receiving my order, the orange juice was missing, so I returned to the counter to request it. While waiting, I witnessed the server retrieve the orange juice from a pitcher in the fridge that was visibly full of mold, with a dark ring of mold inside and the lid also covered. The pitcher was almost empty, and as the server shook it to pour the remaining juice, more mold was disturbed and released into the juice.\\n\\nWhen I pointed out the black, slimy material floating in my juice, the server tried to dismiss it as pulp from \\u201cfresh juice.\\u201d I immediately asked to see the pitcher, and upon inspection, it was clearly contaminated with mold. It is unfortunate that I didn\\u2019t have my phone with me at the time, or I would have taken a picture of the pitcher to document the severity of the situation. The general manager refunded my order, but this is not enough to address the seriousness of the issue.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, when I opened the rest of my order in my car, I discovered that the muffin I had ordered was also moldy. This raises serious concerns about the overall cleanliness and food safety at this establishment. How many other customers have consumed mold-contaminated food or drinks?\\n\\nIt is unacceptable for any restaurant to serve food and beverages that could potentially harm customers. Health and safety protocols exist for a reason, and Chai Berry is clearly failing to follow them. I strongly urge the health department to conduct a thorough audit of this restaurant to ensure the safety of future customers.\\n\\nThis review is lengthy because this situation is truly alarming.

Nestled in a cozy, inviting space, this little gem specializes in gourmet popsicles that are as beautiful to look at as they are delicious to taste.\\n\\nThe first thing that struck me was the ambiance. The shop is impeccably clean, and the decor is vibrant and modern, perfectly reflecting the colorful and creative nature of their offerings. The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, eager to share their passion for these delightful treats.\\n\\nNow, onto the pops themselves. Cielito Artisan Pops offers an impressive variety of flavors, both classic and inventive. Whether you have a sweet tooth or prefer something more refreshing, there is something for everyone. I tried a few different flavors, and each one was a revelation. The fruit-based pops were bursting with fresh, natural flavors, and the cream-based pops were rich and decadent without being overly sweet.\\n\\nOne standout for me was the mango chili pop. It struck the perfect balance between sweet and spicy, with real chunks of mango and a subtle chili kick that left my taste buds tingling. The attention to detail in every pop is evident \\u2013 from the high-quality ingredients to the artistic presentation.\\n\\nCielito Artisan Pops also caters to various dietary preferences, offering vegan, dairy-free, and gluten-free options, making it an inclusive treat spot for everyone. This thoughtful consideration for different needs adds to the overall positive experience.\\n\\nIn addition to the fantastic pops, Cielito Artisan Pops also offers a selection of coffees and other beverages, making it a great spot to relax and unwind. The pricing is reasonable, especially considering the quality and craftsmanship that goes into each pop.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Cielito Artisan Pops is a must-visit for anyone in search of a delightful, gourmet treat.

Just random stuff too.  Like somebody went out of town for vacation or something.  Then I finally moved here and I still have about a 50-50 shot of actually getting food when I visit.  Either they are unexpectedly closed Or they are literally out of Shawarma.  Yesterday I tried to bring a friend here, Hoping them up about how great the food was and they were out of Shawarma.

You see unlike most upscale restaurants I visit, this one was very homey, with the authentic Israeli experience. You see the staff at the Friendship Grill are special needs children from Chabad\\u2019s Friendship Circle organization. These special children learn life skills, make friends, and are made to feel like they are a part of functioning society. It was for that reason that we drove out from Boyton Beach over 45min away. While the children only work there and in the Friendship Caf\\u00e9 next door from morning till 3pm, the place was full of pictures and information about the children. There was even a big screen with photos and captions as well as videos showing them off.  The man behind the grill and fryer, Tomer, a native Israeli, was telling us about how the kids help prep the food, stock the fridge and even take turns manning the cash register. Frankly, it was very inspiring. Tomer loaded our table up with the works. Plenty of piping hot pita bread, dips and salatim including; Carrot Salad, Beet Salad, Eggplant, Matbucha, Cole Slaw, and plenty of Chummus. Naturally we tried everything from the Falafel to the Shwarma and Schnitzel . We also got some delicious fries and sweet potato fries. Behind the restaurant is the Chabad House and Judacia Store. The food was really good and filling. The Falafel, crispy and golden brown on the outside and yummy, fragrant, and green on the inside. The turkey shwarma was juicy and soft, perfect when paired with some pita and chummus. For those that don\\u2019t want bread, they even had some rice and wrap sandwich. The schnitzel was really good. Crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. Honestly, we couldn\\u2019t finish all the food. There was so much variety!  It\\u2019s a great place to eat and even better place to support.

The ceiling is a sculptural cloud \\u2014 soft, organic, otherworldly \\u2014 and the booth we were seated in offered the perfect balance of intimacy and sophistication. You truly feel tucked away in your own little world, yet surrounded by quiet energy and luxury.\\n\\nOur server was warm and gracious, and the hospitality throughout the evening matched the finesse of the food. We began with the bluefin crispy rice \\u2014 not my usual pick (I\\u2019m watching what I eat), but my wife insisted, and she couldn\\u2019t have been more right. The plating was stunning: precise, vibrant, and confident. The crispy base gave just the right crunch, and the bluefin on top was buttery, clean, and impossibly fresh. Topped with avocado, kosho aioli, and a slice of serrano, it was the kind of bite that makes you pause and smile.\\n\\nEach course that followed kept building on that high. The salmon sashimi came out on a glass plate so elegant it felt like it belonged in a gallery. Just one slice, a touch of wasabi, and fresh greens \\u2014 minimalism at its most refined. Every detail was curated, from the delicate layering of the garnishes to the quality of the fish itself.\\n\\nWe also ordered the rice bowl with the fried egg \\u2014 hearty yet still elevated, with umami-packed rice and a beautiful yolk resting like a crown on top. The flavor was bold and comforting, balanced by the sleek presentation.\\n\\nWhat really stood out was how carefully each dish was plated. Nothing was rushed, nothing looked thrown together. It felt like the kitchen was telling a story \\u2014 restrained where it needed to be, daring when it mattered. The glassware, the menu design, even the chopsticks \\u2014 all part of the same elevated experience.\\n\\nWe sipped on cocktails served in chilled, elegant glasses (with edible flowers!), which added a romantic touch to the evening. Even our sparkling water and soda felt thoughtfully presented.\\n\\nHikari isn\\u2019t just about kosher food done well \\u2014 it\\u2019s kosher dining completely reimagined. Sophisticated, confident, and worthy of a night out, this is a restaurant that raises the bar in every category.

I explained that I was from Canada & it absolutely wasn't cod. So, they said it was tilapia. I think it was Pollack and probably freezer burned and I said I would not eat such a horrible meal. They gave me a look, so! I told them I would like to get something else, which they were very put off by. Reluctantly, they asked what I wanted. I told them, Eggplant Parmesan. They rang it up and said I needed to pay the difference. I pointed to their menu board & showed it was the same price. The cashier day manager said their computer showed it at $4 more and that's what I needed to pay. I told them to just forget it and gave them their horrible paid-for meal back.

Like everyone, I have been salivating over the photos and videos on Instagram.  Now, I wanted to try it for myself. I was pleasantly surprised at the ample seating both indoor and out, with a cool and modern decor. We were seated immediately and started browsing the menu. We only had two hours till we had to leave so we decided to go light. Since we landed earlier in the day we started with a Caesar salad, the Chili Mix, Crispy Cauliflower and the Angus Beef Skewers. The food came quickly and we dived right in. Firstly, the Cauliflower was nice and crunchy and crispy, unlike the ones I tasted elsewhere. It was a pleasant surprise. They also had a little kick. The salad was fresh with a delicious dressing. The Chili Mix however, yummmmmm. My wife was skeptical when I ordered it, but after only one bite she was hooked. The chili which consisted of ground beef and black beans, cooked with chipotle peppers and served with Nacho Chips, \\u201csour cream\\u201d (vegan of course) and pico de gallo. I couldn\\u2019t stop eating it. Now lets talk about the Angus Beef Skewers. Wow! Soft flavorful meat on a skewer with some onions and peppers. The meat was so tender and juicy, I honestly could\\u2019ve ended the meal here. Naturally, I wanted to try just one entr\\u00e9e. I went with the Ribeye steak medium rare, which was grilled to perfection. It was soft and flavorful. The Ribeye also came with a side of fries. I also ordered one drink as I was on vacation, I ordered the Golden Margarita. It was the perfect way to end the night. Here is my summary. Great service, really good food, and VERY well priced. The whole meal with tax was just over $200. In the NY/NJ area, a meal like this would be at least double the price. We were also out within an hour and a half of just walking in. Highly recommend.\", \"time\": 1724887112, \"translated\": false}, {\"author_name\": \"Alfhild Halland\", \"author_url\": \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111757696790099242804/reviews\", \"language\": \"en\", \"original_language\": \"en\", \"profile_photo_url\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVZGV8308erUMEvPNW0BkdPtHvJCnYX5OWsd5BjZcsxFHXbFX4Ugg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\", \"rating\": 5, \"relative_time_description\": \"2 years ago\", \"text\": \"Excellent restaurant.

As a loyal customer, I am appalled by the behavior of one of your staff members, Kurteria, and the overall lack of professionalism displayed at this location.\\n\\nWhat happened:\\n\\nUpon arriving at the drive-thru, I was in the process of deciding my order when Kurteria approached my window and asked if she could help. I informed her I was still figuring out what to order. Instead of courteous assistance, she rudely snapped, \\\"Hurry up, I don\\u2019t have all day,\\\" stating she was about to go on her break. I heard another coworker laughing in the background, which only added to the uncomfortable and unprofessional atmosphere.\\n\\nI was stunned by her disrespectful tone and shared my shock with my friends, who confirmed they heard her rude comment. Kurteria then repeated her dismissive remark even as I drove off. As I parked my vehicle and approached the entrance, I saw her inside the establishment at the front door, seemingly preparing to leave, with her keys in hand and her body language indicating she was about to go on break.\\n\\nWhen I asked to speak to the manager, Kurteria falsely claimed she was the manager. She then followed me to the counter, despite claiming to be on break, and proceeded to serve me. I paid for the donuts, which, unfortunately, were completely unacceptable\\u2014dry, overcooked, darker than usual, and inedible. My friends and I had to throw the donuts away due to their poor quality.\\n\\nThis experience is unacceptable on every level:\\n\\nUnprofessional and rude behavior:** Kurteria\\u2019s attitude and language towards a customer are completely inappropriate and uncalled for. This kind of conduct tarnishes the reputation of Krispy Kreme and discourages loyal customers.\\n\\nLack of proper management oversight:** The fact that such behavior went unchecked suggests a serious management failure. Her claim to be the manager, despite her rude behavior, is concerning.\\n\\nSubpar product quality:** The donuts were overcooked and dry, which indicates a lack of attention to quality control.\\n\\nMy call to action:\\n\\nI have already contacted corporate, and they assured me they would investigate. I declined their offer of a replacement dozen donuts, as my primary concern is the conduct of your staff and the overall customer experience at this location.\\n\\nTo Krispy Kreme Corporate:\\nThis incident raises serious questions about staff training, management oversight, and customer service standards at this location. I urge you to take immediate action\\u2014conduct a thorough investigation, provide additional staff training, and ensure that your employees uphold the professionalism and quality standards that Krispy Kreme is known for.\\n\\nCustomers deserve respectful service and consistent product quality. Anything less damages your brand\\u2019s reputation and discourages repeat business.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nThis was a highly disappointing experience that I hope prompts swift action from your corporate team. I trust that Krispy Kreme will address these issues promptly to prevent future incidents and uphold the integrity of your brand.\", \"time\": 1751340271, \"translated\": false}, {\"author_name\": \"Reuben Boyd\", \"author_url\": \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118279349829714093656/reviews\", \"language\": \"en\", \"original_language\": \"en\", \"profile_photo_url\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL1WS3O6Ifd20ECRlxOxha9fmOehl96nzHt82WPiuWG16BsWSc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3\", \"rating\": 3, \"relative_time_description\": \"3 weeks ago\", \"text\": \"Doesn't open at 6, or even 6:15 by any means.

The items I put on my plate: Israeli salad, onions marinated with Sumac, pickles, tabouleh, hickory fries and of course chicken shwarma. Loooved the combination of all the food on the plate. Especially the onions with sumac. This really hit the spot. It was so juicy and flavorful and complemented the rest of the items on my plate so well. Their pita was also soft and fluffy and I loved the hint of char in the middle on it. It really added to the taste. Only thing I would say as a comment is that the chicken was more on the drier end.

The toppings on a veggie pie are fresh, cut to the perfect size, and add a really robust flavor to the already delicious pie, and the plain regular one - with the sweet & tangy sauce, salty and gooey cheese, and crispy yet chewy crust - hands down the BEST pizza anywhere.

This is mostly a tapas place so expect the portion sizes to be on the smaller side (they do have a limited selection of entrees). The place has a nice vibe and the music is at a tasteful volume compared to the other kosher place right next door. A few other notes: at first it wasn't easy to find because there is no signage on top of the building like all the other stores. I know they aren't the only place that does this, and I understand why they do it, but personally I'm not a fan of the mandatory 20% tip. By definition a gratuity should be optional and variable based on the quality of the service. Without the ability to lower the percentage it doesn't exactly encourage good service (although in theory people could give more than 20% I assume people rarely do). And, because it's mandatory, what it really feels like is a psychological pricing trick where you're really paying 20% on top of the menu prices but you don't think about it when you make your selections. In our case the service was decent but not exactly stellar (we had the place to ourselves and it didn't seem like the staff was doting on us though they had nothing else to do). PS. They seem to have a bit of an obsession with sashito peppers not sure why it appears in so many dishes relative to their small menu.\", \"time\": 1701229882, \"translated\": false}, {\"author_name\": \"Shlomo Yusupov\", \"author_url\": \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105783658573142534204/reviews\", \"language\": \"en\", \"original_language\": \"en\", \"profile_photo_url\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI6yKPWmdL0d5i7D1one8ARo5gdMG9PynHBwj4d7VinUQaSmA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3\", \"rating\": 4, \"relative_time_description\": \"2 months ago\", \"text\": \"Overall good experience some of the drinks are a hit or a miss.\", \"time\": 1747314753, \"translated\": false}, {\"author_name\": \"Kosher Food World\", \"author_url\": \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110352001477487610343/reviews\", \"language\": \"en\", \"original_language\": \"en\", \"profile_photo_url\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWOwmXC49mG6kvANDPsMOne4vj73tWyI4DFg2AQe6LoFPc3pDs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\", \"rating\": 5, \"relative_time_description\": \"a year ago\", \"text\": \"We came here to try out a variety of dishes, and taste we did!\\n\\nFor starters, they offered lemon or lime slices with your table water, my husband loves his lemon water so this was a nice touch of service!\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what we ordered:\\n\\n\\u2b50\\ufe0f The street corn \\ud83c\\udf3d\\nThis was the star of the night!

The place is really clean, ORB certificate for those who keep a kosher diet, dairy free kitchen. With the best falafel I've had outside of Israel! Loads of coriander crispy outside and tender almost fluffy inside, really great! The schwarma Turkey on the fire roasted vertical spit was on point!!! I ordered the Schwarma Laffa. The Laffa was tender yet sturdy and toasted warm and soft. Held all of the beautiful toppings in there, carrots, beets, Israeli salad, pickles, sumac onions, hummus, babaganoush, shug, eggplant salad and cabbage salads. Everything was Flavorful/Nostalgic to how I remember it tasting like when I visited Israel many years ago. 100% would recommend this place to everyone. Cannot wait to go back. Have plans this week already for another lunch there. I brought home the pargiyot chicken platter for my wife who loved everything as well.

Honestly, the experience was top notch and not what you would expect from a small chain custard spot. I believe he owns one other location and deserves all the best. I wish they would open more in San Diego again, but for now I'll have to visit this one every time I'm in town.
