## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Features
- **Direct Database Integration**: Maps ORB data directly to current `restaurants` table schema
- **Automatic Kosher Categorization**: Correctly identifies dairy vs pareve restaurants
- **Chalav Yisroel/Stam Logic**: Applies manual categorization rules
- **Pas Yisroel Logic**: Applies manual categorization rules
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Skips existing restaurants
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Python 3.11 Compatible**: Optimized for your system requirements

### Database Schema Mapping
The scraper correctly maps ORB data to your current database schema:
- `name` → restaurant name
- `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code` → parsed from ORB address
- `phone` → extracted phone number
- `website` → restaurant website
- `kosher_type` → dairy/pareve categorization
- `is_cholov_yisroel` → Chalav Yisroel status
- `is_pas_yisroel` → Pas Yisroel status
- `kosher_cert_link` → ORB certificate PDF link
- `image_url` → restaurant photo
- All other required fields properly mapped
