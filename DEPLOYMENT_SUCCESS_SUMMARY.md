# Deployment Success Summary

## Date: January 31, 2025

### Changes Deployed

**Map Page Layout Fix**
- **File Modified**: `frontend/components/LiveMapClient.tsx`
- **Issue**: Action buttons and top navigation bar appeared "flipped around" on the map page
- **Solution**: Reordered the component layout to improve UX flow

### Layout Changes

**Before:**
1. Header (top navigation)
2. Enhanced Search
3. Action Buttons
4. Navigation Tabs

**After:**
1. Header (top navigation)
2. Enhanced Search
3. Navigation Tabs
4. Action Buttons

### Benefits

- **Better UX Flow**: Navigation tabs now appear before action buttons, creating a more intuitive user experience
