# Database Update Summary - Kosher Categorization Fix

## Overview
This document summarizes the database update process that fixed the kosher categorization issue where all restaurants were showing up as dairy instead of properly differentiated meat, dairy, and pareve categories.

## Problem Identified
- **Issue**: All restaurants were categorized as "dairy" in the database
- **Root Cause**: The ORB scraper was not using the correct URL structure to differentiate between meat and dairy restaurants
- **Impact**: Users could not filter by kosher type (meat vs dairy vs pareve)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated ORB Scraper Logic
- **File**: `backend/scrapers/orb_scraper_v2.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `scrape_category_page()` to handle section-based scraping
  - Added `scrape_section()` method to parse dairy and meat sections separately
  - Changed category URLs to use `/category/restaurants/` (main page with sections)
  - Properly differentiates between dairy and meat sections on ORB website

### 2. Database Update Endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app.py`
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/update-database` (POST)
- **Functionality**:
  - Clears all existing restaurant data
  - Runs updated ORB scraper
  - Populates database with correctly categorized data
  - Returns detailed statistics

### 3. Deployment Configuration
- **File**: `render.yaml`
- **Changes**:
  - Added Playwright browser installation to build process
  - Ensures proper deployment on Render

## Results

### Before Fix
- **Total Restaurants**: 107
- **Dairy**: 99 restaurants
- **Meat**: 0 restaurants  
- **Pareve**: 8 restaurants

### After Fix (Expected)
- **Total Restaurants**: ~104
- **Dairy**: ~34 restaurants
- **Meat**: ~57 restaurants
- **Pareve**: ~13 restaurants

### Kosher Supervision Status
- **Chalav Yisroel**: ~99 restaurants
- **Chalav Stam**: ~5 restaurants (only specific 3 restaurants)
- **Pas Yisroel**: ~20 restaurants (only specific listed restaurants)

## Technical Details

### ORB Website Structure
The ORB website organizes restaurants into sections on the main `/category/restaurants/` page:
- **Dairy Section**: "Restaurants Â» Dairy"
- **Meat Section**: "Restaurants Â» Meat"
- **Fish Section**: Separate `/category/fish/` page (pareve)

### Scraper Logic
```python
# For main restaurants page
if '/category/restaurants/' in category_url:
    # Scrape dairy section
    dairy_businesses = await self.scrape_section('dairy')
    # Scrape meat section  
    meat_businesses = await self.scrape_section('meat')
```

### Chalav Yisroel/Stam Logic
- **Chalav Stam**: Only 3 specific restaurants
  - Cafe 95 at JARC
  - Hollywood Deli
  - Sobol Boynton Beach
- **Chalav Yisroel**: All other dairy restaurants

### Pas Yisroel Logic
- **Pas Yisroel**: Only specific 24 restaurants from provided list
- **Regular Pas**: All other restaurants
