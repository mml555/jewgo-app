# Production Database Schema Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The JewGo backend deployment was failing with the following error:

```
column restaurants.rating does not exist
LINE 1: ..., restaurants.longitude AS restaurants_longitude, restaurant...
```

This error occurred because the database schema was missing several columns that the application code expected to exist in the `restaurants` table.

## Root Cause

The database migration script `backend/database/migrations/add_missing_columns.py` had not been run on the production database, causing a mismatch between the expected schema and the actual database structure.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Python 3.11 Virtual Environment

Since the project requires Python 3.11 compatibility, a new virtual environment was created:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv backend/venv_py311
source backend/venv_py311/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Created Production Schema Fix Script

A new script `scripts/maintenance/fix_production_schema.py` was created to:

- Connect directly to the production Neon database
- Add missing columns to the `restaurants` table
- Handle SQLAlchemy 1.4 compatibility issues
- Provide proper error handling and logging

### 3. Missing Columns Added

The following columns were added to the `restaurants` table:

- `cuisine_type` (VARCHAR(100))
- `hechsher_details` (VARCHAR(500))
- `description` (TEXT)
- `latitude` (FLOAT)
- `longitude` (FLOAT)
- `rating` (FLOAT)
- `review_count` (INTEGER)
- `google_rating` (FLOAT)
- `google_review_count` (INTEGER)
- `google_reviews` (TEXT)
- `hours` (TEXT)

### 4. Verification Scripts

Two verification scripts were created to ensure the fix was successful:

- `scripts/maintenance/test_production_api.py` - Tests API endpoints
- `scripts/maintenance/verify_restaurant_data.py` - Verifies restaurant data is returned correctly

## Results

‚úÖ **Database Schema Fix Successful**

- All missing columns have been added to the production database
- The API is now responding correctly without errors
- Restaurant data is being returned successfully
- Health check endpoint is working properly

### API Test Results

```
üè• Testing Health Endpoint
‚úÖ Health check passed
   Status: healthy

üîç Testing Production API
‚úÖ Success: API responded with data
‚úÖ Success: 3 restaurants returned

Restaurant 1:
  Name: Grand Cafe Hollywood
  Address: 2905 Stirling Rd, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33312
  State: FL
  Rating: None
  Google Rating: None
  Kosher Type: dairy
```

## Production Database Details

- **Provider**: Neon (PostgreSQL)
- **Host**: ep-snowy-firefly-aeeo0tbc-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
- **Database**: neondb
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Operational

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `scripts/maintenance/fix_production_schema.py` - Production schema fix script
- `scripts/maintenance/test_production_api.py` - API testing script
- `scripts/maintenance/verify_restaurant_data.py` - Data verification script
- `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_SCHEMA_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files
- `backend/venv_py311/` - New Python 3.11 virtual environment

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production Logs**: Keep an eye on the production logs to ensure no new database errors occur
2. **Update Documentation**: Consider updating deployment documentation to include database migration steps
3. **Automate Migrations**: Consider implementing automated database migrations for future deployments
4. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure regular database backups are in place

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Compatibility**: Always ensure the correct Python version (3.11) is used for this project
2. **Database Migrations**: Database migrations should be run as part of the deployment process
3. **Schema Validation**: Consider implementing schema validation in the application startup
4. **Testing**: Always test database changes in a staging environment before production

## Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Backend API: Operational
- ‚úÖ Database: Schema updated and working
- ‚úÖ Health Checks: Passing
- ‚úÖ Restaurant Data: Being served correctly

The JewGo backend is now fully operational and serving restaurant data without any database schema errors.
