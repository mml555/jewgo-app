# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

## üö® Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Environment Variable Mismatches** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Inconsistent environment variable usage across the codebase:
- Vercel configs used `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Next.js config used `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- API routes used `BACKEND_URL` (not NEXT_PUBLIC_)
- Some pages hardcoded URLs

**Files Fixed**:
- `vercel.json` - Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- `frontend/app/api/restaurants/route.ts` - Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- `frontend/app/api/restaurants/filter-options/route.ts` - Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- `frontend/app/restaurant/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to use environment variable
- `frontend/app/restaurant/[id]/layout.tsx` - Updated to use environment variable
- `frontend/app/admin/specials/page.tsx` - Updated to use environment variable

### 2. **Duplicate Vercel Configuration Files** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Two different `vercel.json` files with conflicting configurations.

**Solution**: Standardized both files to use consistent environment variable names.

### 3. **Hardcoded Backend URLs** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Some components hardcoded backend URLs instead of using environment variables.

**Solution**: Updated all hardcoded URLs to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment variable with fallbacks.

## üîß Additional Recommendations

### 4. **Environment Variable Validation**

Your `validate-env.js` script correctly checks for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`, which now matches your configuration.

### 5. **TypeScript Configuration**

Your `tsconfig.json` has `strict: false` which could hide type errors. Consider enabling strict mode for better type safety.

### 6. **Node Version Compatibility**

Your `package.json` specifies Node 22.x, which is compatible with Vercel's current offerings.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings:

### Required Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` = `https://jewgo.onrender.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = Your Google Maps API key
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = Your NextAuth secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` = Your Vercel deployment URL

### Optional Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` = Google Analytics ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = Cloudinary cloud name
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` = Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` = Google OAuth client secret

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Add all required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. **Deploy**: Push your changes to trigger a new deployment
3. **Verify**: Check that the build process completes successfully
4. **Test**: Verify that all API calls work correctly in production

## üîç Monitoring

After deployment, monitor these areas:
- API response times
- Environment variable availability
- Google Maps API usage
- Database connection status

## üìù Notes

- All environment variables now use consistent naming (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`)
- Fallback URLs are maintained for development environments
- The validation script will catch missing required environment variables during build
- Both Vercel configuration files are now synchronized

This should resolve the deployment mismatches and ensure consistent behavior across environments.
